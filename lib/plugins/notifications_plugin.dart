///
/// The paths are the gateway's, under `/metoer`. The list route is the one
/// read here with a side effect: fetching a page marks it viewed unless the
/// caller says otherwise, so `read_notifications` sends `unmark=true` and a
/// question about the inbox leaves it exactly as it was found. The service has
/// no per-notification read — the SDK's method for one answers 404 — so the
/// set offers the two reads and the one write that exist.
///
/// Reads and the write live in one plugin because they are one grant: the same
/// switch that lets the companion see the inbox is what lets it clear it, and
/// a second switch would only invite the user to believe the first one cannot
/// touch anything.
