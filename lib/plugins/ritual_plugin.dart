/// The check-in is the one thing here that changes the account, and it is

/// ## Why the fortune is drawn here rather than asked for
///
/// There is no fortune of the day to ask for. The Passport service serves the
/// sayings at `/passport/fortune` and one of them at `/passport/fortune/random`,
/// and the second answers a different saying on every call — which is the
/// opposite of what a daily fortune is. So [daily_fortune] reads the list and
/// picks, and is honest in its description that the app is the one picking.
