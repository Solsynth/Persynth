/// [kBuiltInPlugins] is the list of everything the app ships. From it the

///
///  * [pluginEnablementProvider] — which plugins the user has switched on,
///    persisted per plugin. This is the permission boundary: a plugin that is
///    off is not offered to the model at all, so switching it off is a
///    capability removed rather than a refusal the model could argue past.
///  * [pluginToolsProvider] — the tools the loaded plugins offer, read by the
///    chat controller on every run and by the client-tool dispatch.
///  * [pluginSkillsProvider] — the names of the on-demand plugins that could
///    still be loaded, advertised to the server so its `list_skills` can offer
///    them alongside its own.
///  * [pluginSystemPromptProvider] — the prompt text the loaded ones
///    contribute, sent with the run as its `context`.
///
/// The settings page iterates the registry directly, so a new plugin appears
/// there — switch, description and any rows of its own — without an edit.
