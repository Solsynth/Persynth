/// The user's Solar Network wallet: what it holds, and what moved through it.
///
/// Read-only, and the boundary is load-bearing. Moving money on Solar Network
/// is authorised by the user's local payment PIN, which this app does not hold
/// and must never ask for — so there is no transfer, order, gift or
/// subscription tool here, and none should be added. A plugin that offered one
/// would have to collect a PIN the app is not entitled to see, and the model
/// would learn to ask the user for it. Reading a balance and asking the user
/// to spend it in the app is the whole of what this grant covers.
///
/// Both tools name the gateway path they read and project the decoded JSON,
/// rather than calling the SDK's typed methods. The wallet model has kept
/// moving — pockets grew `held_amount`, the statistics answer grew its
/// category maps — and a projection over the raw body reads a field the
/// service stops sending as a missing value instead of failing the call.
///
/// On demand: the companion needs a balance rarely, and a user who leaves the
/// switch off should not pay for the definitions on every run.
