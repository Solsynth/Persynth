/// The plugin contract: one self-contained capability pack for the companion.
///
/// A plugin owns everything a feature needs to exist — the tools the model may
/// call on this device, the system prompt text that tells the model they are
/// there, and the settings row the user grants it with. Nothing in the chat
/// loop, the run request, the tool dispatch or the settings page names an
/// individual plugin: they all read the registry in [plugin_registry.dart].
///
/// Adding a feature is therefore: write one class, add it to `kBuiltInPlugins`.
/// Nothing else has to change.
///
/// ## Eager and on-demand tools
///
/// A plugin with [SnPlugin.onDemand] false offers its tools on every run: the
/// right choice for a small set the companion reaches for constantly. An
/// on-demand plugin offers nothing until the model activates it by name, which
/// is the right choice for a large or rarely-used set — the definitions cost
/// context on every request whether or not they are called. The registry
/// advertises [activateLocalSkillToolName], and the server lists what is
/// available to activate alongside its own skills, so the model sees one
/// catalogue either way.
///
/// ## Two rules a plugin author inherits from the wire format
///
///  * Name a tool for what it does (`web_search`), not for where it runs. The
///    server puts every client-owned name under [kLocalToolNamespace] before
///    the model sees it, so a plugin's name can never collide with a
///    server-owned tool however it is chosen.
///  * Everything a plugin does is account-scoped: it runs as the signed-in
///    user, on the user's own connection.
